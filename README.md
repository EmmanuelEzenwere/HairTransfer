# HairTransfer

HairTransfer is a Python program that uses computer vision and deep learning to transfer hairstyles from one face to another.

Deep learning is applied to recognize face shapes to customize user hairstyle feeds to only consist of faces with similar face shapes to ensure quality HairTransfer.

TensorFlow was used for deep learning. The Inception V3 deep learning model was retrained to recognize five face shapes.
